CASH SECURED PUT RECOMMENDATIONS - QUICK INTERPRETATION GUIDE
================================================================================

COLUMNS YOU NEED TO KNOW:
================================================================================

ticker                  → Which stock
current_stock_price     → Current market price
strike                  → Price you'd buy at if assigned
premium_received        → YOUR INCOME (per share)
annual_return          → Yearly return %
prob_otm               → % chance it expires worthless (you keep premium)
delta                  → Assignment probability (negative for puts)
days_to_expiration     → Days until expiration
capital_required       → Cash needed (usually strike × 100)

WITH CASH FILTERING ENABLED:
max_affordable_contracts    → How many contracts you can afford
total_capital_required      → Total cash needed
total_premium_received      → Total income if you sell max contracts

================================================================================
HOW TO READ A ROW:
================================================================================

Example Row:
NVDA, $142.50, $135, 2024-11-22, 28 days, $2.80, 29.5%, 68%, -0.32, $13,500

Translation:
"Sell 1 put on NVDA at $135 strike expiring Nov 22 (28 days).
 You receive $280 immediately ($2.80 × 100 shares).
 Returns 29.5% annualized.
 68% chance it expires worthless (you keep $280 and that's it).
 32% chance you buy 100 NVDA shares at $135 ($13,500 total).
 If assigned, your effective price is $132.20 ($135 - $2.80 premium).
 That's 7.2% below current price of $142.50."

================================================================================
DECISION TREE:
================================================================================

1. Can I afford it?
   Check: capital_required or total_capital_required
   Your cash: $27,000 available, $22,000 deployable

2. Do I want this stock?
   Check: ticker, net_purchase_price
   Would you buy this stock at that price?

3. Is the return good enough?
   Check: annual_return
   Target: 15-25% (conservative), 25-40% (aggressive)

4. What's my risk?
   Check: prob_otm, delta
   70%+ prob_otm = safer
   -0.30 or lower delta = safer

5. Can I exit if needed?
   Check: volume, openInterest
   100+ volume = good liquidity

================================================================================
WHAT TO LOOK FOR:
================================================================================

CONSERVATIVE (Income without assignment):
✓ prob_otm > 70%
✓ delta < -0.30
✓ annual_return > 15%
✓ volume > 100

AGGRESSIVE (High returns, accept risk):
✓ annual_return > 30%
✓ prob_otm > 50%
✓ volume > 100
✓ Accept higher delta

WHEEL STRATEGY (Want to own stock):
✓ discount_from_current > 5%
✓ Stocks you actually want
✓ annual_return > 20%
✓ Don't care about prob_otm (you WANT assignment)

================================================================================
HOW TO USE THE CSV FILE:
================================================================================

IN EXCEL:
1. Open the CSV file
2. Sort by "annual_return" (high to low) for best returns
3. Sort by "prob_otm" (high to low) for safest trades
4. Filter columns:
   - prob_otm > 70 (safer)
   - volume > 100 (liquid)
   - annual_return > 20 (good return)
5. Look at top 10 rows
6. Pick the one that fits your goals

QUICK FILTER EXAMPLES:

For Safety:
- Sort by: prob_otm (high to low)
- Result: Safest trades first

For Income:
- Sort by: annual_return (high to low)
- Filter: prob_otm > 70
- Result: Best income with good safety

For Your $22,000 Cash:
- Filter: total_capital_required < 22000
- Result: Only what you can afford

================================================================================
THE MOST IMPORTANT QUESTION:
================================================================================

"Am I okay owning this stock at the net_purchase_price?"

Example:
NVDA at $132.20 (if assigned) vs $142.50 (current) = 7.2% discount
→ YES! I'd love NVDA at that price ✓

TSLA at $242 (if assigned) vs $245 (current) = 1.2% discount
→ Risky! Only 1.2% discount and TSLA is volatile ✗

================================================================================
COMMON PITFALLS TO AVOID:
================================================================================

✗ High premium but very low prob_otm
  → You'll probably be assigned, are you ready?

✗ Low volume (< 50)
  → Hard to close if you change your mind

✗ Strike above current price (ITM)
  → Very high assignment risk

✗ More capital than you have
  → Check capital_required vs your cash

✗ Stock you don't want to own
  → NEVER sell puts on stocks you hate!

================================================================================
YOUR SPECIFIC SITUATION (from config.py):
================================================================================

Available Cash: $27,000
Reserve: $5,000
Deployable: $22,000 ($27k - $5k)
Max per position: $27,000

What you can do:
- Any put with capital_required < $22,000
- About 2-3 contracts at $100 strike
- Or 1 contract at $200 strike
- Or 0.5 contracts at $400 strike (can't do fractional, so 0)

Your watchlist includes: AAPL, MSFT, NVDA, AMD, TSLA, GOOGL, AMZN, META, NET, QQQ

Focus on these tickers in your CSV!
